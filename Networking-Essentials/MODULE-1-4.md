## Module 1: Communications in a Connected World

<details>
<summary> 1.1 Network Types ✅ </summary>
<br>
  
- People think of the internet as a formless collection of connections, a "place" where people go to find or share information.
- The internet isn't owned by any individual or group, instead it is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks, cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards.

#### Local Networks:

| Small Home Networks | Small Office and Home Office Networks aka SOHO | Medium to Large Networks | World wide Networks |
| ----                | ----                                           | ----                     | ----                |
| connect a few computers to each other and to the internet | Allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources | Networks used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts | Network of networks that connects computers world-wide |

- Many different devices cnnect to the internet:
  - Some obvious ones are: Computers, smartphones, smart TV, tablets, smartwatches, smart glasses and gaming console.
  - Home Devices: Security system and appliances (fridge, ovens, dishwasher).
  - Other: Smaart cars, RFID tags (can be **placed in or on objects to track them**), sensors and medical devices.

<summary> 1.2 Data Transmission ✅ </summary>
<br>

#### Types of Personal Data:

| Volunteer data | Inferred data | Observed data |
| ----           | ----          | ----          |
| Data that you offer yourself, know is being collected and you agree to share | Data that you generate by your activities, that you may not concent to | Data collected by observing and recording events, behaviors, or phenomena as they naturally occur |
| e.g. social network profiles; videos, pictures, text or audio files | e.g. Credit score; which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data | e.g. location data when using cell phones |  

- A bit (**binary digit**) is the **smallest unit of data** that a computer can process and store.
  - E.g. Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store.
  - CPU = a complex set of electronic circuitry that **runs the machine's operating system and apps**.

#### Common Methods of data Transmission:

- ***Media*** refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. e.g. **copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves** through the air.
- Signals may be converted multiple times before reaching the destination, as **corresponding media changes along the way**.

| Electrical signals | Optical signals | Wireless signals | 
|  ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Transmission is achieved by representing data as **electrical pulses on copper wire **| Transmission is achieved by converting the **electrical signals into light pulses** | Transmission is **achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air** |

<summary> 1.3 Bandwith and Throughtput ✅ </summary>
<br>

- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time.
  
NOTE: Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics all play a role in determining available bandwidth.

| Unit of Bandwidth | abbreviation | Equivalence | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Bits per second | bps | 1bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth |
| Bilobits per second | Kbps | 1kbps = 1,000 bps = 10^3 bps |
| Megabits per second | Mbps | 1kbps = 1,000,000 bps = 10^6 bps |
| Gigabits per second | Gbps | 1kbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 10^9 bps |
| Terabits per second | Tbps | 1kbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 10^12 bps |

#### Throughput:
- Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. It measured the amount of data sent and recieved over a connection, and any delays in either dirrection.
- Some influencing factors:
  - The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
  - The types of data being transmitted
  - The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
- Latency = **the amount of time**, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
